# d8-timeline-starter
starting point for learning web development by building a timeline in drupal 8

## user requirements

[captain obvious] Timelines are useful for journaling. Some situations demand clear, granular records of the most obvious, high-level occurrences and reactions (including stakeholder input, project changes, ...). 

[captain meta-overview] This website allows all registered users to contribute content. | Future, but not currently available: users who can view content can also submit pull requests for changes to that content.

Different roles allow access to different levels of detail. Not all content will be available to all users.


### as an authenticated user, I can

[captain specialsauce] 
- search, filter, sort information in a timeline so that themes more effectively emerge
- add/edit details to improve the timeline
